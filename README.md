# Data Analysis with Python [freeCodeCamp]

This repository contains solutions to freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-course) course projects, demonstrating my skills and understanding of data analysis in Python using pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and scipy.

## Course Modules

The course is structured into five main projects, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis:
1. [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](<Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator/README.md>)
2. [Demographic Data Analyzer](<Demographic Data Analyzer/README.md>)
3. [Medical Data Visualizer](<Medical Data Visualizer/README.md>)
4. [Page View Time Series Visualizer](<Page View Time Series Visualizer/README.md>)
5. [Sea Level Predictor](<Sea Level Predictor/README.md>)

Each module directory contains:
 - The main notebook implementing the solution.
 - A README.md file providing an overview and the objectives of the project.
