# Data Analysis with Python [freeCodeCamp]

This repository contains solutions to freeCodeCamp's [Data Analysis with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/#data-analysis-with-python-course) course projects, demonstrating my skills and understanding of data analysis in Python using pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

## Course Modules

The course is structured into five main projects, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis:
1. [Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](<Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator/>)
2. [Demographic Data Analyzer](<Demographic Data Analyzer/>)
3. [Medical Data Visualizer](<Medical Data Visualizer/>)
4. [Page View Time Series Visualizer](<Page View Time Series Visualizer/>)
5. [Sea Level Predictor](<Sea Level Predictor/>)

Each module directory contains:
 - The main notebook implementing the project.
 - A README.md file providing an overview and the objectives of the project.
